# LLM-Study (Language Models Study and Implementation)
This repository serves as a study and implementation space for understanding and working with large language models. 
## Introduction 
Language models are powerful tools that can generate human-like text, answer questions, and perform various natural language processing tasks. This project aims to explore the inner workings of such models and implement them for practical use. 
## Repository Structure 
The repository is organized as follows:
-  models/ : This directory contains the implementations of different language models. 
-  data/ : Here, you can find example datasets used for training and evaluation. 
-  notebooks/ : Jupyter notebooks showcasing the usage and experimentation with language models. 
-  utils/ : Utility functions and helper scripts for data preprocessing, evaluation, etc. 
-  examples/ : Code snippets and examples demonstrating the usage of the implemented models. 
## Getting Started 
To get started with this project, follow these steps: 
1. Clone the repository:  git clone https://github.com/your-username/language-models-study.git>  
2. Install the required dependencies:  pip install -r requirements.txt  
3. Explore the  notebooks/  directory to understand the implementation details and experiment with the models. 
4. Check out the  examples/  directory for code snippets and usage examples. 
5. Feel free to contribute, report issues, or suggest improvements by creating a pull request or opening an issue.
